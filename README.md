# BJSU-Club

Botanical Jupiter Saturness Unicorn Club

## Final Project

### Project Summary

For our project, we are doing a website on various figures in mythology. We chose this topic because we each have a fascination with different mythologies from differing cultures and wanted accumulate these stories into one place.

### Key Takeaways

We are doing this project to enhance our understanding of creating websites through code. We are thinking about what information we want to show but also how we want to depict it. This is a good practice of our creativity when it comes to design but also our comprehension of basic code aspects. We like creatures and Crystal likes unicorns :)

### Core Webpages

Our home page will consist of an aesthetically pleasing front page which will introduce our concepts (creatures). The title of our website will be "The Botanical Jupiter Saturness Unicorn Club's Mythological Archive". We will have our page names at the top of our nav bar and you will be able to click on the names to navigate through pages.
Our 4 myth pages will have 4 different creatures, one page dedicated to each creature. There will be images along with text about the creatures and fun facts that we want to include. Each page will have it's own unique look.
The contact page will be a professional contact form with a message explaining how and why to contact us.
There will also be an "About" page with a picture of the web developers (us) and information about us and our education.
