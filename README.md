Botanical Jupiter Saturness Unicorn Club

## Final Project

### Project Summary

For our project, we made a website on various figures in mythology. We chose this topic because we each have a fascination with different mythologies from differing cultures and wanted accumulate these stories into one place.

### Key Takeaways

We did this project to enhance our understanding of creating websites through code. We thought about what information we wanted to show but also how we wanted to depict it. This was a good practice of our creativity when it comes to design but also our comprehension of basic code aspects. We like creatures and Crystal likes unicorns :)

### Core Webpages

Our home page consists of an aesthetically pleasing front page which introduces our concepts (creatures). The title of our website is "The Botanical Jupiter Saturness Unicorn Club's Mythological Archive". We have our page names at the top of our nav bar and you can click on the names to navigate through pages.
Our 4 myth pages have 4 different creatures, one page dedicated to each creature. There are images along with text about the creatures and fun facts that we wanted to include. Each page has it's own unique look.
The contact page is a professional contact form with a message explaining how and why to contact us.
There is also be an "About" page with a picture of the web developers (us) and information about us and our education.

### Design Choices

- https://www.theoi.com/

We really liked how easy these websites were to navigate to find out more about whatever creature interested you. The color palettes are relatively simple, but go well with the topics. Good spacing inbetween most of the elements.

Web Pages - Final Update\*

Grant worked on the content that went on the Dragon and Sasquatch section of the core webpages.
Likewise, Crystal did the same for the Unicorn and the Phoenix sections.
They both did valuable research that we included into these portions of our website!
I (Sophie) worked on making a nav bar as well as formatting the pages so that you are able to navigate around the website easily.
My job was done before they were able to input their found information into the pages.
